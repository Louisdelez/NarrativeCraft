## Concept
Do you want to create your own Life is Strange game, or Until Then game, or any narrative game you can think of? NarrativeCraft is a tool that makes this possible with a plot twist: you don't need to know how to code, all thanks to the Ink narrative scripting system.

Create your own unique stories with endearing characters, let your imagination take form in a 3D sandbox, with shaders, music, and cutscenes.

This mod is mainly written to be singleplayer-only, to create adventure maps. Multiplayer is not supported yet.

## Features

- Ink integration
- Support for custom triggers and commands
- Made to be accessible to anybody
- Organized structure
- Customizable (main screen, credits, dialogues...)
- All-in-one system (player recording, cutscenes, multiple recordings at the same time)

## Mod compatibility
- EmoteCraft: Emotes will be recorded, and you can play them from ink script.

## How does it work?

NarrativeCraft uses a narrative scripting language called [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), which is open-source and highly scalable for integration into other projects. The Java integration was made by [bladecoder](https://github.com/bladecoder/).

Ink is a great narrative scripting language because:
- It's easy to learn.
- Dialogues come first, logic later.
- It has enough advanced features to create complex stories.

NarrativeCraft is the middleman that interprets your dialogues and events as in-game actions.  
By events, I mean custom lines you can write to trigger in-game actions. For example, changing the time, weather, playing cutscenes...

## What does it look like in-game?

I'm glad you asked! I made a small showcase to demonstrate what this mod is capable of:

## I want to start making stories

You can start learning from the NarrativeCraft [documentation](https://loudo56.github.io/NarrativeCraft-docs/getting-started/introduction-to-narrativecraft.html).

## Contribution

This mod is meant to be developed and used with the community. My goal is to make story creation easily accessible to as many people as possible.

If you're experienced in Minecraft modding or Java in general, any suggestions to refactor or improve the code are greatly appreciated.
