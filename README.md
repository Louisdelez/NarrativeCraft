## Concept
NarrativeCraft is a Minecraft mod that turns the game into a space for building interactive stories, with choices and branching narratives that react to the player’s decisions.

It's mostly for creating a game in a game and is highly inspired from games I love like Life Is Strange and Until Then.

It's all-in-one (recording, cutscene, rendering dialogs, story management) and is designed to be easy to use.

Create your own unique stories with endearing characters, let your imagination take form in a 3D sandbox, with shaders, music, and cutscenes.

This mod is mainly written to be singleplayer-only, to create adventure maps. Multiplayer is not supported yet.

## Features

- Ink integration
- Support for custom triggers and commands
- Made to be accessible to anybody
- Organized structure
- Customizable (main screen, credits, dialogues...)
- All-in-one system (player recording, cutscenes, multiple recordings at the same time)

## Mod compatibility
- EmoteCraft: Emotes will be recorded, and you can play them from ink script.

## How does it work?

NarrativeCraft uses a narrative scripting language called [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), which is open-source and highly scalable for integration into other projects. The Java integration was made by [bladecoder](https://github.com/bladecoder/).

Ink is a great narrative scripting language because:
- It's easy to learn.
- Dialogues come first, logic later.
- It has enough advanced features to create complex stories.

NarrativeCraft is the middleman that interprets your dialogues and events as in-game actions.  
By events, I mean custom lines you can write to trigger in-game actions. For example, changing the time, weather, playing cutscenes...

## What does it look like in-game?

I'm glad you asked! I made a small showcase to demonstrate what this mod is capable of:

## Contribution

This mod is meant to be developed and used with the community. My goal is to make story creation easily accessible to as many people as possible.

If you're experienced in Minecraft modding or Java in general, any suggestions to refactor or improve the code are greatly appreciated.
